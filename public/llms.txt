# HexaGlue

> HexaGlue is an architecture compiler for Java applications following Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

At compile time, HexaGlue turns your codebase into a semantic graph of architectural intent: automatic classification, architecture audit, living documentation, and JPA code generation. Zero runtime dependency.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Classification**: Detects Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Identifiers, Domain Events, Ports and Services automatically from your Java source code.
- **Architecture Audit**: Validates hexagonal architecture and DDD rules at compile time, generating detailed reports with scores, grades, and remediation guidance.
- **Living Documentation**: Generates synchronized documentation from your domain code, including domain model diagrams, type inventories, and relationship graphs.
- **JPA Code Generation**: Produces JPA entities and repositories from your domain model, aligned with your hexagonal architecture.
- **Zero Runtime**: Operates only at compile time via a Maven plugin. Nothing is embedded in production. No vendor lock-in.
